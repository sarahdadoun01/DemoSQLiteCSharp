### What this app does

* This app allows a user to enter their name and email and creates an object of type Employee which is saved in the database.
* When `Save` button is clicked, a ListView displays the list of Employees using a method called GetEmployees()
* Items in the list are clickable, allowing the user to `Edit` or `Delete`.
* If `Edit` button is clicked, the values appear in the Entries, allowing the user to easily modify the data.
  * When the `Save` button is clicked after modifying, the data is then updated as well as the ListView.
